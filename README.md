# CPUs(UESTC-计算机组成与原理)
This repository contains my lab assignments for Computer Organization and Architecture course at UESTC. The labs focus on designing and implementing various fundamental components of a CPU and a complete CPU system.
## CPU Implementations

### Basic Single-Cycle CPU
- Complete datapath design
- Control unit implementation
- Instruction set architecture support
- Memory interface
- Basic I/O handling

### Advanced CPU with Exception & Interrupt Handling
- Exception detection and handling mechanism
- Interrupt controller design
- Priority-based interrupt processing
- Context switching support
- Exception vector table implementation
- Status and control registers for interrupt management

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado
- ModelSim for simulation
- FPGA development board for testing

Each component and CPU implementation includes:
- Detailed design documentation
- Verilog source code
- Test benches
- Simulation results
- Performance analysis

Feel free to explore the code and documentation in the respective directories. DONT CHEAT IN YOUR HOMEWORK.
